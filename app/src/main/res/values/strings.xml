respective particular terms and conditions. \n\n

The use, the provision and/or the contracting of the products and services offered by

Videona may be subject to the previous acceptance of formal requisites such as the filling

out of corresponding forms, payment of costs and/or the previous acceptance of the

specific terms and conditions which apply to it.\n\n

In every case, the access, the navigation and the use of the Platform and the use or the

contracting of the services or products offered through the Platform is the sole and

exclusive responsibility of the User. The User is therefore bound to diligently and faithfully

observe any additional instructions given by Videona or by Videona’s authorised

employees in relation to the Platform and its contents’ use.\n\n

correct and lawful manner, complying with the current legislation. In particular, the User

of general public morality, ethics or public order, or which is in any way contrary to

established forms required to access the corresponding products or services. If, as a result

of the User’s registration, a password is issued, the User thereby is bound to use it

temporarily or permanently, nor to provide access to others. The use and/or contracting of

circumstances which may lead to the improper use of identifying data and/or passwords,

such as theft, loss or non-authorised access, so that Videona can proceed with immediate

cancellation. Until the circumstances are communicated to Videona, Videona will be

exempt from any responsibility which could derive from the improper use of the identifying

data or use or misuse of passwords by third parties.\n\n

operation of and to avoid the existence and transmission of viruses and other damaging

components which could potentially harm Users.\n\n

Videona has applied all reasonable measures to avoid errors in the contents published in

third parties and/or the content that is threatening, obscene, defamatory, pornographic,

to current legislation, or any conduct of the User which incites or constitutes a criminal

offence, is totally prohibited.\n\n

Likewise, the inclusion and communication of contents by Users which i) are false or

inaccurate or may induce error or mislead other Users or Videona’s personnel, ii)  infringe

the intellectual property rights of third parties, iii) may undermine or harm the reputation or

image of Videona, iv) may be considered as illegal, misleading or unfair advertising, or

If the User infringes the above prohibitions/restrictions or Videona has reasonable grounds

to suspect that a User has infringed any of the same, Videona reserves the right to

suspend or terminate the User\´s account and to refuse any and all current or future use of

the products, services and/or the Platform (or any portion thereof).\n\n

For further information see Videona Guidelines.\n\n

7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS \n\n

All intellectual property rights in and to all contents within the Platform are reserved and, in

particular, it is forbidden to modify, copy, reproduce, publicly communicate, transform or

distribute in any way the totality or part of any contents included in the Platform for public

or commercial means unless with the prior, express and written authorisation of Videona

or, as the case may be, from the third party owner or rights holder of the same.\n\n


Access to and navigation through the Platform shall in no case be understood as a

relinquishment, transmission, licence or total or partial transfer of any rights by Videona

howsoever, unless otherwise expressly stated within the particular conditions which

regulates the use, provision and/or contracting of the products or services, if any, provided

through the Platform. Consequently, it is not permitted to delete, evade or manipulate any

indicators of  rights ownership (for example “copyright”, “©”, “trademark” or “™” indicators)

or other identifying data, whether in favour of Videona or any other parties, and/or any

technical protection mechanisms, fingerprints or whichever information or identification

mechanisms may be contained in, or otherwise pertain to, any contents.\n\n

Any references to names and commercial or registered brands, logos or other distinctive

marks, which are owned by Videona or by others, implicitly forbid their use without the

authorisation from Videona or from the owner or the rights holder. At no time, unless

otherwise expressly stated, the access or use of the Platform and/or its contents shall give

the User any right whatsoever to the brands, logos and/or distinctive signs included in the

Platform, each of which is protected by Law.\n\n

The non authorized use and exploitation of the Platform contents or any other conduct

which may infringe any intellectual property rights, will lead to the legal responsibility as set

out within the applicable regulation.\n\n

8. LINKS\n\n

8.1 Links from the Platform to other apps or websites.\n\n

Videona may offer direct or indirect links to other apps or websites which are outside of the

Platform. The presence of these links in the Platform have a purely informative purpose

only and at no time constitute an invitation to purchase the products and/or services

offered on such websites. Furthermore, no such link implies the existence of a branch

relationship with the entity owning the website to which the link is offered. In any such

case, Videona will not be responsible for establishing general conditions to be taken into

account in the use, provision or contracting of or for any such services or products and,

therefore, Videona may not be held responsible in any way in relation with it.\n\n

Videona does not have the knowledge, human resources or technical means to control or

approve the information, contents, products or services provided by or through other

websites to which it offers a link from the Platform. Consequently, Videona will not take

any responsibility for any matters relating to such third party websites linked with the

Platform.\n\n

Notwithstanding the above, where Videona becomes aware that the activity or the

information which it links to is illegal and will lead to a crime or damage the rights or

property of third parties, it will act with the necessary diligence to delete or cease from

using the corresponding link at the earliest opportunity.\n\n

Likewise, if Users become aware of the illegality of the activities carried out through any

such third party websites, they will be under the obligation to communicate such matter to

Videona at the earliest reasonable opportunity such that Videona may evaluate the same

and act appropriately.\n\n

For the avoidance of doubt, if a “frame” is opened when accessing a certain web site,

where the logo of Videona is shown, it will not imply that Videona is the owner of the

referred web sites; the owner will be the entity referred as such within the web site.

8.2 Links from other web pages to the Platform.\n\n

If any User, entity or webpage wishes to establish a link to the Platform of any nature, they

must comply with the following conditions:\n\n

(i) They will need to obtain previous, express and written authorisation from Videona or

being authorised by any Videona specific conditions.\n\n

prior written approval, no declaration of any nature may be made to the effect that

Videona has authorised the link. If the entity providing the link from its webpage to

the Platform wishes to include on its own webpage any brand, denomination,

commercial name, label, logo or any other sign which identifies Videona and/or the

Platform, they must obtain previous, express and written authorisation from Videona.

(iii) Videona forbids the link to the Platform from all those webpages which contain

materials, information or contents which are illegal, degrading, obscene and, in

general, which infringe upon morality, public order, current legislation, generally

accepted social rules or which harm the legitimate rights of third parties.\n\n

services, subscribe to newsletters, carry out any registration process or request

information, among others), the User will be alerted as to the need to provide his/her

personal data.\n\n

In any event, the collection and processing of personal data will be carried out in

compliance with the requirements of the applicable data protection regulations as well as

the Privacy Policy which forms an integral part of this Legal Notice.\n\n

10. DURATION AND MODIFICATION\n\n

Videona reserves the right to modify this Legal Notice and the particular terms and

conditions which may have been established for the use and/or contracting of the products

and services provided through the Platform, whenever it considers it appropriate and/or in

order to adapt and comply with any changes in legislation and in technology which have

become effective since the last publication of the same on the Platform.\n\n

The term of this Legal Notice coincides with the duration of its publication and exhibition in

the Platform, until such time as it is totally or partially modified. At such moment, the

modified terms and conditions will become binding.\n\n

11. COMMUNICATIONS\n\n

The User must contact with Videona through the postal and/or email address provided on

the Platform. Communications from Videona to the User must comply with the contact

information provided by the User. The User therefore expressly accepts the use of the

terms and conditions which may be established in relation to any specific products or

services offered in the Platform, the latter will prevail.\n\n

totally or partially binding by a Court of Law or by a recognised Administrative body, such

nullity will not affect the other provisions contained in this Legal Notice nor any other

provisions which have been established.\n\n

Where Videona does not exercise any of the rights contained in this Legal Notice, such

event will not constitute a relinquishment of this right, unless expressly stated in writing.\n\n

be governed exclusively by the laws of Spain.\n\n
